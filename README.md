# Unity-Project-View-Stickies

Project/Hierarchy Stickies for Unity

This asset was inspired by Stickies application and allows you to attach multiple colorful text notes to files/folders in Project View. Ever wanted to add note about certain file/folder for your teammates to see or add memo to texture/script/prefab/any file?

IMPORTANT!!! Hierarchy support is experimental and somewhat limited when using prefabs (can only attach to root of prefab in scene) due to Unity Editor API limitations.

Features:
- Add a colorful note with useful information to any file/folder in Project/Hieararchy view.
- Customizing note color (lemon, grass, blue, amethyst, rose, clean)
- Rich text support.
- Data is saved in .asset file so everything is persisted inside your project.
- Notes accessible right from project/hierarchy view as well as adding new notes
- Preferences to configure font size, offset in project/hierarchy view and more.
